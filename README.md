# Huffman-Encoder
A binary encoder and decoder using the Huffman encoding algorithm

Main method can be found in HuffmanDemo.java 
When ran, a prompt for the input file will be presented 
- Type the text you want encoded into InputText.txt and enter that exact filename into the terminal
- The encoded text will appear in Encoded.txt and the breakdown from the Huffman encoding algorithm can be found in Huffman.txt

To decode
- Enter the filename Encoded.txt into the terminal when prompted for a file to read from
- Enter the filename Huffman.txt into the terminal when prompted for a file with Huffman codes
- The decoded text will appear in Decoded.txt
